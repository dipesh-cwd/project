        <h2>About us </h2>
        <p>Welcome to RideNow!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We are a group of three passionate students on a mission to make
          vehicle rentals more accessible and user-friendly. As part of our
          academic journey, we decided to tackle real-world problems with
          practical solutions and that's how this project was born.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our goal is to create a platform where users can easily find and rent
          vehicles, whether for daily commuting, road trips, or business needs.
          Through this website, we aim to bring convenience and transparency to
          the rental process while sharpening our skills as aspiring developers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We're excited to share this project with you and hope to make a
          positive impact in the world of vehicle rentals. Your feedback and
          support mean the world to us as we continue to learn, grow, and
          improve our platform.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Thank you for being a part of our journey!</p>

        <h2>Vehicle rental in Nepal </h2>
        <p>
          Rent in Nepal is a useful platform where you can rent almost anything
          you need in Nepal at a fair price. You can rent cars, jeeps, buses,
          hice and even bike for any time period that suits you. With so many
          options available, itâ€™s easy to find what you need without spending
          too much time.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          This platform is great for people who prefer renting instead of
          buying. Rent in Nepal makes renting simple and convenient for
          everyone!
